First, generate your identity key on arduino board (nrs01)

dropbearkey -t rsa -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa

Since dropbear stores its keys in different format, it needs to be converted for a standard SSH server:

dropbearkey -y -f ~/.ssh/id_rsa | grep "^ssh-rsa " >> authorized_keys

Now copy or (concatenate) "authorized_keys" to ~/.ssh on "webhost". Ensure that permissions on this file are set to 600.
You should now be able to ssh without a password.

root@nas:~# ssh user@webhost -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa
